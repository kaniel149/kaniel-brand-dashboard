# Reddit & Community Research - Course Creation Practical Intelligence
## Honest Advice from Real Course Creators (Reddit, Forums, Communities)
### Compiled: February 7, 2026

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Research across Reddit communities (r/coursecreation, r/Entrepreneur, r/passive_income, r/videography, r/solopreneur), Udemy instructor forums, and course creator communities reveals **brutally honest insights** that differ significantly from the polished advice of top creators. The key theme: **most first-time course creators fail because they overengineer production and underengineer marketing.** Audio quality matters 10x more than video quality. Most students never finish courses. And $27 is the exact right price for a 30-minute mini-course -- low enough for impulse buys, high enough to filter freebie-seekers.

### Top 10 Reddit-Sourced Truths for Kaniel:

1. **Audio is king, video is secondary** -- People will watch grainy footage but click away from bad audio. Invest in a $50-70 lav mic before anything else.
2. **Record 1080p at 30fps** -- Don't waste storage on 4K for course content. Nobody watches courses on a 65" TV.
3. **Outdoor recording in Koh Phangan is a liability, not an asset** -- Wind noise, insects, unpredictable light. Record INDOORS with natural window light as your key light. Use outdoor shots ONLY for b-roll and intro/outro.
4. **Screen recordings need zoom-ins and cursor highlights** -- Static screen recordings are the #1 reason students zone out. Use FocuSee or Tella's built-in zoom to auto-zoom on clicks.
5. **75% of course creators make less than $1,000/year** -- The money is NOT in the course itself. It's in the funnel: free content -> email list -> course -> upsell -> coaching.
6. **Don't build before you validate** -- 10 presales or don't record. Period.
7. **Completion rates are horrific** -- Industry average is 13.8%. Justin Welsh's 75-minute course achieves 45% by keeping it SHORT. Your 30-minute course is the right length.
8. **Perfectionism kills more courses than bad content** -- Ship "good enough," iterate based on feedback.
9. **Email marketing outsells social media by 3-5x** -- Social media announces, email sells.
10. **The real money at $27 is in the upsell math** -- $27 x 100 sales = $2,700. But if 10% buy a $999 bootcamp, that's $9,990. The course is the door, not the room.

## 1. RECORDING SETUP -- WHAT iPHONE OWNERS ACTUALLY USE

### The Real-World Solo Creator Setup

**From course creators and videography communities:**

| Component | Budget Option | Mid-Range | What Redditors Say |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Camera** | iPhone (any recent model) | iPhone 16 Pro | "Your phone camera is better than what most YouTube creators used 5 years ago" |
| **Microphone** | Boya BY-M1 ($20) | Rode Wireless GO ($100) or DJI Mic 2 ($170) | "Audio is the #1 thing that makes or breaks a course. Get a lav mic." |
| **Tripod** | Any phone tripod ($15) | Joby GorillaPod ($30) | "Mandatory. Shaky footage = amateur hour" |
| **Lighting** | Window + white curtain | Ring light ($30-90) | "Natural window light looks better than 90% of ring lights" |
| **Background** | Clean wall or bookshelf | Simple shelf with plants | "Nobody cares about your background if your content is good" |

### iPhone Recording Settings (Consensus)

```
Resolution: 1080p (NOT 4K -- saves storage, faster upload, students won't notice)
Frame Rate: 30fps (natural look, smaller files)
Format: H.264 "Most Compatible" (not HEVC -- editing software compatibility)
Focus: Tap and hold face to lock AE/AF
Lens: Main lens (1x) -- avoid ultrawide distortion on faces
Grid: Enable (rule of thirds for framing)
HDR: OFF for course content (causes issues in editing)
```

### Audio Equipment Rankings (from Reddit Consensus)

**Tier 1 - "Just Start" ($0-20):**
- iPhone built-in mic -- acceptable if room is quiet and you're close
- Boya BY-M1 wired lav mic ($15-20) -- massive quality jump for almost no money

**Tier 2 - "Getting Serious" ($50-100):**
- Rode Wireless GO ($100) -- wireless freedom, good quality
- Blue Snowball USB mic ($50-70) -- great for desk/screen recording sessions
- DJI Mic Mini ($60) -- wireless, compact, good noise canceling

**Tier 3 - "Professional" ($150-300):**
- DJI Mic 2 ($170) -- best overall for iPhone creators, noise canceling, 32-bit float recording
- Rode Wireless Micro ($80-100) -- simple, reliable
- Blue Yeti USB ($100-130) -- multiple pickup patterns, studio quality

**Critical Audio Tips (from real creators):**
- "Test your audio EVERY session. I lost 2 hours of footage because my mic wasn't connected."
- "Set levels between -12db and -3db. Too quiet = background hiss. Too loud = clipping."
- "Clap at the start of each recording -- it helps sync audio if using external mic."
- "Close doors, windows, turn off AC/fans. You won't hear them while recording but the mic will."

### Lighting: Natural vs Artificial

**The Reddit consensus is clear: natural window light wins for beginners.**

**Setup that works:**
1. Face a window (the bigger the better)
2. Sit 3-5 feet from the window
3. Overcast day = best (soft, even, no harsh shadows)
4. If sunny: hang a white bedsheet or curtain to diffuse
5. NEVER sit with a window behind you (creates silhouette)

**When to use artificial light:**
- Recording at night or in a room with no windows
- Inconsistent weather makes natural light unreliable
- You want to batch record regardless of time of day

**Artificial light recommendations:**
- Ring light ($30-90): "Lowest learning curve, decent results, but can cause distracting ring reflection in glasses"
- LED panel ($40-80): "More flexible, more natural look than ring light"
- Two desk lamps with daylight bulbs ($15): "Ghetto but works surprisingly well"

### CRITICAL: Recording in Koh Phangan Specifically

**Outdoor recording challenges (from tropical filming communities):**

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Wind noise** | Use a "dead cat" windscreen on mic ($5-10). Or record indoors. |
| **Insect noise** | Record early morning (6-8am) before insects are active |
| **Sun movement** | Golden hour (6-7am, 5-6pm) is cinematic but brief. Overcast = more consistent. |
| **Humidity** | Lens fog when going from AC to outside. Let lens acclimate 5-10 min. |
| **Unpredictable rain** | Always have indoor backup plan |
| **Background noise** | Motorbikes, dogs, roosters, construction. Record INSIDE with windows closed. |

**Recommendation:** Record talking head INDOORS with window light. Use outdoor Koh Phangan footage ONLY for b-roll intros (waves, palm trees, sunset -- without dialogue). This gives you the "tropical lifestyle" visual without the audio nightmare.

## 2. SCREEN RECORDING -- HOW TO MAKE IT NOT BORING

### The #1 Complaint About Screen Recording Courses

> "I bought a course that was literally 4 hours of someone slowly moving their mouse around a screen while mumbling. I wanted to die." -- Reddit user

**What makes screen recordings engaging (from course creator communities):**

1. **Zoom in on key actions** -- When clicking a button or typing, zoom in so viewers can see exactly what's happening
2. **Highlight cursor movements** -- Use click effects (ripple, glow) so viewers can follow your mouse
3. **Talk WHILE you do things** -- Don't silently navigate then explain. Narrate in real-time.
4. **Cut dead time** -- Remove loading screens, typing pauses, "um" moments
5. **Use annotations** -- Draw arrows, circles, highlight text on screen
6. **Change layouts** -- Toggle between screen-only and screen+face. Don't keep the same layout for 10 minutes straight.

### Software Recommendations (Reddit Consensus)

**For Kaniel's use case (screen recording + talking head, Mac):**

| Tool | Price | Best For | Reddit Verdict |
|------|-------|----------|---------------|
| **Tella** | $9/mo | Clip-based recording, built-in editing | "Best for course creators, period" |
| **ScreenStory** | $15/mo | Auto-zoom on clicks | "Magic -- makes screen recordings look like a million bucks" |
| **FocuSee** | $49 one-time | AI auto-zoom + cursor effects | "Set it and forget it, auto-edits your recordings" |
| **Loom** | Free/$15/mo | Quick recordings | "Fine for Slack videos, too limited for courses" |
| **OBS Studio** | Free | Advanced users | "Powerful but steep learning curve. Overkill for courses." |
| **ScreenPal** | $6/mo | Budget option | "Good enough, has annotation tools built in" |
| **Descript** | $24/mo | Edit by editing transcript | "Mind-blowing concept but sometimes buggy" |

**Screen Recording Pro Tips:**

1. **Resolution:** Record at 1920x1080 (full HD). Lower your display resolution if on a Retina display -- otherwise text is tiny in the recording.
2. **Font size:** Increase browser zoom to 125-150% before recording. Small text = squinting students.
3. **Clean desktop:** Hide dock, close notification center, use a simple wallpaper, close all apps except what you're demonstrating.
4. **Browser:** Use a clean Chrome profile with no extensions/bookmarks showing. Remove personal bookmarks.
5. **Cursor size:** Increase cursor size in System Settings so it's visible in the recording.
6. **Keyboard shortcuts:** Show keyboard presses on screen (KeyCastr for Mac, free) so students can follow along.

### The Hybrid Format (Talking Head + Screen)

**The winning format from successful course creators:**

```
[0:00-0:15] TALKING HEAD - "In this lesson, you'll learn to..."
[0:15-0:30] TALKING HEAD - Quick context/why this matters
[0:30-5:00] SCREEN RECORDING with face bubble in corner
[5:00-5:15] TALKING HEAD - Quick recap
[5:15-5:30] TALKING HEAD - "Next, go do X. In the next lesson, we'll..."
```

**Face bubble tips:**
- Bottom-left or bottom-right corner
- Small enough not to block content (~15-20% of screen)
- Some creators remove face during complex screen sections
- "The face bubble humanizes screen recordings. Without it, students feel like they're watching documentation."

## 3. COURSE STRUCTURE -- WHAT STUDENTS ACTUALLY WANT

### What Students Complain About (Reddit + Forum Threads)

**Top complaints about online courses (most upvoted):**

1. **"Too long, too much filler"** -- "I paid for a 10-hour course and the actual content is 2 hours. The rest is the instructor repeating themselves."
2. **"No practical exercises"** -- "I watched all the videos and still don't know how to DO the thing."
3. **"Outdated content"** -- "The UI in the course is completely different from the current version."
4. **"Bad audio quality"** -- "I couldn't focus because of the constant background hiss."
5. **"No clear structure"** -- "I finished the course and I'm not sure what I actually learned."
6. **"Too much theory, not enough doing"** -- "Show me HOW, don't just tell me WHY."
7. **"No support"** -- "I got stuck and there's no way to ask questions."
8. **"Feels like a YouTube video I paid for"** -- "Why did I pay $50 for something I could've found free?"

### What Students LOVE (from positive reviews)

1. **"Short and actionable"** -- "I finished the whole thing in one sitting and built my first X."
2. **"Great supporting materials"** -- "The templates and checklists alone were worth the price."
3. **"Real results, not theory"** -- "By the end of lesson 3, I had a working X."
4. **"The instructor is real"** -- "He admitted what he doesn't know. Felt honest, not salesy."
5. **"Quick wins early"** -- "I got a result in the first 10 minutes. That hooked me."

### Lesson Length Research

**The consensus from multiple Reddit threads and course platform data:**

| Length | Engagement | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Under 3 min | Very high | Good for tips, but feels too short for a paid course |
| **5-7 min** | **Highest** | **Sweet spot for course lessons** |
| 8-10 min | Good | Still works, but engagement drops at end |
| 10-15 min | Moderate | Split into 2 if possible |
| 15-20 min | Low | "That's a YouTube video, not a course lesson" |
| 20+ min | Very low | "Only works for live workshops, not recorded courses" |

**For Kaniel's 30-min course: 5 lessons x 6 minutes = optimal.**

### How to Start and End Each Lesson

**Start (first 15 seconds):**
1. State the outcome: "By the end of this lesson, you'll have X"
2. Show the end result: "Here's what we're building" (show finished product)
3. Create urgency: "This is the part most people get wrong"

**End (last 30 seconds):**
1. Recap in ONE sentence: "Today you learned to X"
2. Give an action step: "Before the next lesson, go do Y"
3. Tease next lesson: "In the next lesson, we'll build on this by..."
4. DO NOT end with "thanks for watching" -- it's not YouTube

### Attention-Keeping Techniques

**From the most-upvoted Reddit advice:**

1. **Pattern interrupts every 60-90 seconds** -- Change camera angle, switch from screen to face, change visual, show a graphic
2. **"Open loops"** -- "Later I'll show you the trick that made this 10x faster..." (keeps them watching)
3. **Talk faster than you think you should** -- "Slow talkers get fast-forwarded. Slightly faster pace keeps attention."
4. **Use concrete numbers** -- "5 steps" is better than "some steps." "Save 2 hours" is better than "save time."
5. **Tell micro-stories** -- "Last week I was working with a client who..." (even 20 seconds of story resets attention)
6. **Visual variety** -- Don't show the same screen for more than 2 minutes straight

## 4. EDITING -- WHAT SOLO CREATORS ACTUALLY DO

### Time Investment (Honest Estimates)

**From real solo course creators:**

| Task | Beginner | Experienced |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Recording 1 lesson (6 min final) | 20-30 min | 10-15 min |
| Basic editing (cuts, trims) | 30-60 min | 15-20 min |
| Adding captions | 20-30 min (manual) | 5 min (AI auto) |
| Adding zoom effects | 15-20 min | 5-10 min |
| Exporting + uploading | 10-15 min | 10-15 min |
| **Total per lesson** | **~2 hours** | **~45 min** |
| **Total for 5 lessons** | **~10 hours** | **~4 hours** |

### The "Minimum Viable Edit" Approach

**What Reddit creators recommend for first-time course makers:**

1. **Cut mistakes** -- Remove stumbles, long pauses, "ums"
2. **Add captions** -- Auto-generated (Tella, Descript, CapCut)
3. **Basic zoom-ins** -- On key moments during screen recording
4. **NO fancy transitions** -- Simple cuts. Fades if needed.
5. **NO intro/outro animations** -- Waste of time. Students skip them anyway.
6. **NO background music** -- Distracting for educational content

**Tools for minimum effort editing:**
- **CapCut** (free): Auto-captions, basic cuts, fast export. "I edit my entire course in CapCut on my phone."
- **Tella** ($9/mo): Record + edit in same tool. Remove filler words automatically.
- **Descript** ($24/mo): "Edit video like editing a Word document." Delete text to delete video.

### The "No Editing" Approach

Some successful course creators on Reddit advocate for zero editing:

> "My course that made $200K has literally zero editing. I just hit record, teach, and upload. Students don't care about production value. They care about learning the thing."

> "I spent 3 months editing my first course to perfection. 12 sales. My second course I recorded and uploaded same-day. 400+ sales. The content was better, not the production."

**When to use this approach:**
- Screen recordings with voiceover (no face = no need to cut awkward moments)
- You're naturally articulate and don't stumble often
- You use Tella's clip-based recording (record in segments, no editing needed)

## 5. COMMON MISTAKES -- WHAT FIRST-TIME COURSE CREATORS REGRET

### The Most Upvoted Regrets from Course Creator Communities

**1. "I spent 6 months building a course nobody wanted"**
- Fix: Presell with a landing page. 10 sales = green light. 0 sales = pivot.

**2. "I over-invested in equipment before validating the idea"**
- Fix: Start with your phone and a $20 mic. Upgrade AFTER your first 50 sales.

**3. "I tried to include EVERYTHING I know"**
- Fix: One specific outcome. "After this course, you will be able to [X]." If it doesn't serve X, cut it.

**4. "I priced too low and attracted the worst students"**
- Fix: $27 minimum. Under $10 attracts freebie-seekers who complain and don't engage.

**5. "I launched on social media with no email list"**
- Fix: Build a list of at least 100-300 emails before launching. Email converts 3-5x better than social.

**6. "I thought the course would sell itself"**
- Fix: 80% of your time post-launch should be marketing, not course improvement. The best course nobody knows about makes $0.

**7. "I recorded everything in one take and didn't review"**
- Fix: Play back EVERY recording before moving to the next lesson. Finding a bad mic or lighting issue after recording all 5 lessons is devastating.

**8. "I didn't get feedback before the public launch"**
- Fix: Give 3-5 people free access before public launch. Their feedback will catch issues you can't see.

**9. "I put it on Udemy thinking the platform would bring students"**
- Fix: Udemy's algorithm favors established courses. New creators get buried. Use your own platform (like Kaniel's GitHub Pages setup) + Gumroad/LemonSqueezy for payments.

**10. "I recorded in my perfect home office and it was boring"**
- Fix: Vary your recording locations slightly. Different backgrounds for different lessons can help maintain visual interest. (But keep audio consistent!)

### Mistakes Specific to $27 Mini-Courses

1. **Adding too many bonuses** -- "People are busy. 5 lessons + 3 templates is enough. Don't overwhelm."
2. **Making it feel like a freebie** -- "Even at $27, frame it as a premium product. Nice sales page, professional delivery."
3. **No follow-up sequence** -- "The $27 is the start, not the end. Set up email sequence for upsells."
4. **No completion trigger** -- "Add a congratulations email when they finish. Ask for a testimonial."

---

## 6. PRICING -- WHAT WORKS AT THE $27-$50 RANGE

### The Low-Ticket Funnel Economics

**From r/Entrepreneur and course creator communities:**

```
FUNNEL MATH FOR $27 MINI-COURSE:

Traffic: 1,000 visitors to sales page
Conversion rate: 2-5% (typical for cold traffic)
Sales: 20-50 x $27 = $540-$1,350

PLUS UPSELLS:
Order bump ($9-19 add-on at checkout): 30% take rate
  20-50 sales x 30% x $14 avg = $84-$210

One-time offer on thank you page ($47-97): 10% take rate
  20-50 sales x 10% x $67 avg = $134-$335

Email upsell to bootcamp ($999): 2-5% of course buyers
  20-50 buyers x 3% x $999 = $599-$1,498

TOTAL REVENUE PER 1,000 VISITORS: $1,357-$3,393
```

**The lesson: The $27 price is the DOOR, not the revenue engine.**

### What Reddit Says About Pricing Psychology at $27

- "Prices ending in 7 convert better than 9 in course sales. Don't ask me why."
- "At $27, the decision is 'is this worth skipping one lunch out?' -- easy yes."
- "Don't offer a free trial for $27. It's already so cheap that free devalues it."
- "NEVER discount below $19. Going to $9.99 attracts refund-seekers."
- "Compare your price to something expensive: 'Less than a single hour of consulting ($150/hr)...'"

### Multi-Currency Strategy (for Hebrew + English + Spanish)

| Market | Price | Currency | Notes |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|
| Israel (Hebrew) | 97 NIS | ILS | "97 feels like a steal for Israelis" |
| US/Global (English) | $27 | USD | Standard low-ticket price |
| LatAm (Spanish) | $19-25 | USD | Lower purchasing power, adjust slightly |

**Key insight from international course sellers:**
> "Charge in local currency when possible. Israelis seeing $27 do a mental conversion and it feels more expensive than 97 NIS (which is roughly the same). The psychology of local currency matters."

## 7. LAUNCH STRATEGY -- HOW TO GET FIRST 10-50 SALES

### The Honest Reality from Reddit

> "I launched my course to 0 email subscribers and made 0 sales. Shocked pikachu face." -- r/Entrepreneur

> "My first launch: 300 email subscribers, 12 sales ($324). Not life-changing money, but enough validation to keep going." -- r/passive_income

> "The courses that sell from day 1 are from creators who spent 6-12 months building an audience first. If you're starting from 0, expect 3-6 months of content before your first launch." -- r/coursecreation

### Practical Launch Tactics (Most Upvoted)

**Phase 1: Pre-Launch (2-4 weeks before)**
1. Post "building in public" content -- Share screenshots of your course being built
2. Give free value around your topic -- 3-5 posts that solve related problems
3. Create a waitlist/interest page -- Collect emails
4. Share behind-the-scenes in Stories -- "Recording day vibes" type content
5. Ask your audience what they struggle with -- DM poll, Story poll
6. Goal: 100-300 email signups before launch day

**Phase 2: Soft Launch (Days 1-3)**
1. Email your list with early access
2. Offer launch price ($19 instead of $27 for first 20-50 buyers)
3. Ask 3-5 friends/colleagues to go through it and give honest feedback
4. Fix any issues they find immediately
5. Ask early completers for a testimonial (even 1-2 sentences is gold)

**Phase 3: Public Launch (Days 4-7)**
1. Instagram Reel: "I built a course" announcement
2. Price goes to full $27
3. Share 1-2 testimonials from soft launch
4. Send 3-5 emails to your list over the week (not just one)
5. Instagram Stories with countdown: "Launch price ends in 48 hours"
6. DM anyone who engaged with your pre-launch content

**Phase 4: Evergreen (Ongoing)**
1. Add course link to Instagram bio
2. Pin 3 best posts that naturally lead to the course
3. Create "pillar content" posts that solve surface-level problems -> "Want the full system? Link in bio"
4. Run the scorecard -> results page recommends the course
5. Weekly content that references what's in the course

### Email Marketing Specifics

**From course creator communities:**

- "I used to convert with 18 emails. Now it takes 24+ before someone buys." (2025 reality)
- "Send at least 5 launch emails, not 2. Most people need 3+ touchpoints."
- "Your email welcome sequence should deliver value FIRST, then pitch the course on email 3-4."

**Suggested launch email sequence:**
```
Email 1 (Launch day): "It's live! Here's what's inside" + early bird price
Email 2 (Day 2): "Why I built this" -- personal story email
Email 3 (Day 3): "What students are saying" -- testimonials/results
Email 4 (Day 5): "Your questions answered" -- FAQ + objection handling
Email 5 (Day 7): "Last chance for launch price" -- urgency + recap value
```

### What Actually Drives First Sales

**Ranked by effectiveness (Reddit consensus):**

1. **Direct outreach** -- DM people you know who need this (not spam, genuine)
2. **Email list** -- Warmest audience, highest conversion
3. **Instagram Stories** -- More personal, higher engagement than feed
4. **Instagram Reels** -- Broader reach but lower conversion
5. **Reddit/forums** -- Only if you're an active member (don't spam)
6. **Twitter/X** -- Good for tech/AI audiences
7. **Paid ads** -- Don't do this until you have organic traction

**The uncomfortable truth:**
> "Your first 10-20 sales will probably come from people you personally message. That's not spam, that's called starting a business. The scalable stuff comes later."

## 8. WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS FOR AI/TECH COURSES SPECIFICALLY

### Insights from AI Course Creators on Reddit

**What works in the AI education space:**

1. **"Show, don't tell"** -- Screen recordings of REAL AI interactions beat slides every time
2. **Use real examples** -- "Don't show 'write me a poem.' Show 'here's how I automated my invoicing.'"
3. **Be specific about tools** -- "How to use Claude" beats "How to use AI"
4. **Acknowledge the pace of change** -- "I update my course quarterly. I tell students: 'If a UI looks different, the principle still applies.'"
5. **Positioning as "for non-technical people"** -- This is the biggest market. "Most people on Reddit searching for AI help are NOT developers."

**What DOESN'T work:**

1. "How to make money with AI" -- Too generic, sounds scammy
2. "Intro to AI/ML" -- Too academic, people want practical skills
3. Long theoretical explanations -- "Just show me what to type"
4. Courses that don't have the student DO something by the end

### Hebrew AI Content Opportunity

**Confirmed from multiple searches:**

- Zero Hebrew-language courses on Claude specifically
- Hebrew AI content on Instagram is almost nonexistent
- Israeli tech audience is sophisticated but underserved in Hebrew
- The #1 pain point on Reddit for beginners: "Where do I even start?" -- Your course answers this directly

---

## 9. PLATFORM STRATEGY -- OWN YOUR PLATFORM

### The Reddit Consensus on Course Platforms

**Why Udemy is NOT recommended for a $27 course:**
- Udemy discounts your $27 course to $9.99 during sales (which is constantly)
- You keep only 37% of Udemy-sourced sales ($3.70 per sale at $9.99)
- You don't get student emails (can't build a list)
- You're competing against free courses on the same platform

**Why self-hosted (like Kaniel's GitHub Pages) + payment processor is ideal:**
- Keep 90-97% of revenue (LemonSqueezy takes 5% + $0.50)
- Own your student data and emails
- Control the full experience and funnel
- No platform algorithms deciding your visibility

**Recommended stack for $27 course:**
1. **Course delivery:** Your own website (already built on GitHub Pages)
2. **Payment:** LemonSqueezy (5% + $0.50) or Gumroad (10% + $0.50)
3. **Email:** ConvertKit / Mailchimp (free tier to start)
4. **Analytics:** Simple Google Analytics or Plausible

### LemonSqueezy vs Gumroad (for $27 products)

| Factor | LemonSqueezy | Gumroad |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Fee | 5% + $0.50 | 10% + $0.50 |
| Your take on $27 sale | $25.15 | $23.80 |
| Tax handling | Built-in (handles VAT globally) | Manual |
| UI | Modern, clean | Functional, dated |
| Checkout page | Customizable | Less flexible |
| Affiliate system | Built-in | Built-in |
| Reddit verdict | "Better deal, better product" | "Established, more trusted" |

**Recommendation: LemonSqueezy** -- lower fees, handles international taxes automatically (important for Hebrew + English + Spanish course).

## 10. OVERCOMING CAMERA ANXIETY

### What Reddit Says About Being on Camera

**The most upvoted advice:**

1. **"Talk to one person"** -- Imagine your best friend sitting across from you asking for help. Don't "present" -- just explain.
2. **"Your first 10 videos will suck. Film them anyway."** -- Nobody's first video is good. The only way to get better is to do more.
3. **"Imperfection is actually better"** -- "People connect with real humans, not polished robots. A few 'ums' and pauses make you relatable."
4. **"Record 3 minutes of garbage first"** -- Talk about anything. Warm up. Then start the real recording.
5. **"Don't watch your recordings immediately"** -- "I used to cringe at myself. Now I just check audio levels, trim the obvious mistakes, and move on."

### Mindset Shifts

- "Focus on what you're teaching, not how you look"
- "People aren't judging your appearance -- they're evaluating your content"
- "The audience you want is the audience that connects with your real personality, not a polished version"
- "Energy on camera requires being at 120% of your normal energy. What feels 'too much' in person reads as 'engaged' on screen."

---

## 11. POST-LAUNCH -- THE 90-DAY PLAYBOOK

### What Happens After You Launch

**From Reddit course creators who shared their post-launch experience:**

**Week 1-2: Launch spike**
- Most sales happen in the first 3-5 days
- Then sales drop to near-zero
- This is normal and not a sign of failure

**Week 3-4: The "valley of death"**
- Almost no sales
- You question everything
- Most creators quit here
- "The dip is real. Push through it."

**Month 2: Building the evergreen machine**
- Shift from "launching" to "content marketing"
- Every Instagram post should naturally lead to your course
- Optimize your bio/link tree
- Start collecting and posting testimonials
- Consider running the scorecard to drive traffic

**Month 3: Iteration and upsell**
- Update course based on student feedback
- Launch upsell product (bootcamp, templates, coaching)
- Consider affiliates (give past students a link to share)
- Raise price to $37-47 if demand supports it

### Revenue Benchmarks (Honest, Not Hype)

**What's realistic for a first-time creator with <2,000 followers:**

| Timeframe | Sales | Revenue | Notes |
|-----------|-------|---------|-------|
| Launch week | 10-30 | $270-$810 | Mostly from direct outreach + email list |
| Month 1 total | 30-60 | $810-$1,620 | Includes launch spike |
| Month 2 | 15-30 | $405-$810 | Evergreen, content-driven |
| Month 3 | 20-40 | $540-$1,080 | Optimization kicks in |
| **90-day total** | **65-130** | **$1,755-$3,510** | **Before upsells** |

**With upsells (order bump + OTO + bootcamp waitlist):**
- Add 30-50% to revenue
- 90-day realistic total: **$2,300-$5,000**

**The creators who break out:**
- Someone with 5,000+ followers and a 500+ email list can 3-5x these numbers
- Viral content during launch can 10x results (but you can't plan for this)

## 12. KEY QUOTES COLLECTION (Most Upvoted Advice)

> "The best online course is the one that's actually published. Stop planning. Start recording."

> "Audio quality is the #1 thing that separates amateur from professional. Everything else is secondary."

> "Your course doesn't need to be comprehensive. It needs to be completable."

> "Don't build for perfection. Build for 'version 1' and iterate based on what students actually ask."

> "The money isn't in the $27. The money is in the email address you collect and the relationship you build."

> "People don't buy courses. They buy outcomes. 'Learn AI' doesn't sell. 'Get 2 hours back every day' sells."

> "Ship it scared. Your first version will be imperfect. That's fine. Perfect courses that never launch make $0."

> "I've sold $400K in courses and my recording setup is still an iPhone on a tripod with a $20 lav mic. Nobody has ever complained about video quality."

> "Screen recordings without zoom-ins are like reading a book in 6pt font. Zoom in. Highlight. Make it obvious."

> "Build your email list before you build your course. An email list of 300 people interested in your topic is worth more than 10,000 Instagram followers."
