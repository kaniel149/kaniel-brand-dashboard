# Course Creation Research - Complete Playbook
## How to Create, Film, Edit, and Sell a Mini-Course as a Solo Creator (2025-2026)
### Compiled: February 7, 2026 (Updated with YouTube/Web deep research)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Research across 60+ sources from top course creators (Justin Welsh, Dan Koe, Ali Abdaal, Pat Flynn, Amy Porterfield, Wes Kao, Jay Clouse, Ole Lehmann, Caleb Wojcik, Nicolas Cole) reveals a clear playbook for solo course creators. The key insight: **simplicity wins**. The most successful solo creators use Loom/Tella/Descript for screen recording, keep lessons under 6 minutes each, batch record everything in 1 day, price mini-courses at $27-$97, and launch to a pre-built email list.

### Top 10 Takeaways for Kaniel's "Your First AI Assistant" Course:

1. **Record with Tella or Descript** - Tella lets you record in clips and fix mistakes. Descript lets you edit video by editing the transcript text (remove filler words with one click, cut 60-70% of editing time).
2. **Batch record ALL 5 lessons in one morning** - 30 min of content = ~2-3 hours of recording time including retakes. Do it in one sitting for visual consistency.
3. **$27 is the right price point** - Low enough for impulse buys (3-5% conversion at checkout when under $30), high enough to filter non-serious people. Upsell path to bootcamp at 999 NIS is the real revenue play.
4. **Presell before filming** - Validate demand with a landing page + email list FIRST. Jay Clouse's rule: 10 presales before investing time in full production.
5. **Dan Koe's formula: Written curriculum + Screen walkthrough + Templates** - The simplest, most proven format for solo digital products.
6. **Amy Porterfield's Minimum Viable Course** - Create it NOW, build it over time. Don't wait for perfection. Ship, get feedback, iterate.
7. **Wes Kao: 80% HOW, 20% WHAT/WHY** - Students don't need more theory. They need step-by-step practical instructions.
8. **Audio quality matters 10x more than video quality** - 75% of highly-rated courses have clear voiceover. Invest in a $30-70 lavalier mic, not a better camera.
9. **Courses under 2 hours have 70-90% completion rates** - Your 30-minute course is perfectly positioned. Longer courses (10+ hours) drop to 20-40% completion.
10. **Low-ticket funnel math: 10 sales/day x $27 = $8,100/month** - With a 30% upsell conversion at $47, that adds ~$4,230/month. Realistic with steady content.

## 1. COURSE STRUCTURE & LENGTH

### The Data on Ideal Course Length

| Course Type | Duration | Price Range | Completion Rate |
|-------------|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Mini-course** | 30 min - 2 hours | $20-$100 | 70-90% |
| Standard course | 3-8 hours | $100-$400 | 50-70% |
| Signature course | 8-20 hours | $500-$2,000+ | 20-40% |
| Cohort-based | 4-6 weeks | $500-$3,000+ | Varies |

**Source: SchoolMaker 2026 research**

### Optimal Lesson Length by Type

| Lesson Type | Duration | Notes |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| Intro lessons | 2-3 min | Set expectations, build excitement |
| Main lessons | 5-10 min | Core teaching. Attention drops sharply after 10 min |
| Demos/tutorials | Up to 12-15 min | Acceptable because students follow along |
| Recaps/takeaways | 2-4 min | Reinforce key points |

**Key data point:** Courses above $200 achieve 61% higher completion rates than sub-$50 courses (students who pay more engage more). But for a first product building trust, $27 is correct.

### Kaniel's Course Structure (Validated by Research)

```
TOTAL: ~30 minutes, 5 lessons

Lesson 1: Why AI Now (Talking Head)           → 5 min
Lesson 2: Install Claude (Screen + Face)       → 7 min
Lesson 3: Your First Conversation (Screen)     → 7 min
Lesson 4: Build Your Assistant (Screen)        → 7 min
Lesson 5: Your System Going Forward (Talking)  → 5 min
```

This structure matches the research perfectly:
- Under 2 hours = 70-90% completion rate
- 5-10 min per lesson = optimal attention span
- Busy professionals want 3-5 hours max (yours is even shorter = better)

### Lesson Structure Formula (Per Lesson)

```
1. HOOK (10 sec) - "In this lesson, you'll learn exactly how to..."
2. CONTEXT (30 sec) - Why this matters for YOUR life
3. CORE TEACHING (3-4 min) - The actual step-by-step content
4. DEMO/EXAMPLE (1-2 min) - Show it live on screen
5. ACTION STEP (30 sec) - "Now pause this video and do this ONE thing"
```

### Wes Kao's Critical Rule: 80/20

> "Most instructors spend 80% on the WHAT and WHY, and 20% on the HOW. In effective courses, you want 20% on what/why and 80% on HOW."

**For Kaniel:** Less "AI is changing the world" philosophy, more "open Claude, type this exact prompt, click here, copy this template."

### Supporting Materials Per Lesson (Double Perceived Value)

Below each video include:
- Text summary (3-5 bullet points of key takeaways)
- Assignment/action step (one specific thing to do)
- Resource links
- Downloadable template/prompt (where applicable)
- Link to next lesson

## 2. FILMING SETUP (Solo Creator, iPhone, Budget)

### The Core Principle

> "Production quality ranks BEHIND perceived learning in viewer preferences." - Podia research

Audio quality is 10x more important than video quality. Students forgive mediocre video but abandon courses with bad audio.

### Equipment Checklist (Budget: $50-$200 total)

| Item | Recommendation | Cost | Priority |
|------|---------------|------|----------|
| **Camera** | iPhone 16 (already owned) | $0 | Have it |
| **Tripod** | Any phone tripod with adjustable height | $15-30 | MUST HAVE |
| **Microphone** | Wireless lavalier (see below) | $30-70 | CRITICAL |
| **Lighting** | Natural window light + optional ring light | $0-90 | Important |
| **Screen Recording** | Tella ($9/mo) or Descript ($24/mo) | $9-24/mo | Needed |
| **Teleprompter** | BIGVU (free tier) or PromptSmart (free) | $0 | Nice to have |

### Microphone Options (In Priority Order)

1. **Wireless Lavalier for iPhone** - BEST for talking head
   - SYNCO G1L (~$50) - plug-and-play, no Bluetooth, auto-pairs in 1 second
   - Rode SmartLav+ ($69) - industry standard clip-on mic
   - BOYA BY-WM3T2-D2 (~$40) - budget wireless, decent quality
   - Any USB-C wireless lav ($30-60 on Amazon) - look for "plug and play"

2. **Blue Snowball USB** ($70) - For desk/screen recording with voiceover
   - Plug into laptop, record screen + voice
   - "Adequate for course quality" per multiple creators

3. **iPhone built-in mic** - Acceptable if environment is quiet
   - Works surprisingly well in small, carpeted rooms
   - Add EarPods/AirPods for slightly better voice isolation

**Microphone placement tips:**
- Clip lav mic to edge of clothing (shirt seam, jacket lapel)
- Keep mic free of clothing that could rub against it
- Distance: 6-8 inches from mouth
- Test 30 seconds before every recording session

### Lighting Setup (3 Options, Cheapest to Most Professional)

**Option A: Window Light Only (FREE)**
- Face a window (the light faces YOU, not behind you)
- Cloudy day = BEST light (soft, flattering, no harsh shadows)
- Problem: sun/clouds shift during recording, creating inconsistent lighting
- Best times in Koh Phangan: early morning (6-8 AM) or late afternoon (4-5 PM)

**Option B: Window + Ring Light ($40-90)**
- Ring light fills in shadows that window light misses
- Mount iPhone in center of ring light
- Position window to one side (key light), ring light in front (fill light)
- Neewer 18" Ring Light ($90) - most recommended for course creators
- Any 10" ring light ($40-60) works for close-up talking head

**Option C: One-Light Tabletop Setup ($50-100)**
- Single softbox or LED panel aimed at your face
- Position slightly above and to one side (45-degree angle)
- Creates professional look with minimal gear
- Lume Cube Broadcast Set ($100) - designed for webcam/desk setup

**Lighting rules:**
- More light = better iPhone footage (less grain/noise)
- Never sit with a window BEHIND you (creates dark silhouette)
- Avoid direct harsh sunlight (creates hard shadows on face)
- Test at different times of day to find your best window

### Camera Setup (iPhone)

1. **Lock exposure and focus** - Tap and hold on your face in the Camera app
2. **Resolution:** 4K if storage allows, 1080p minimum
3. **Orientation:** HORIZONTAL/LANDSCAPE for course videos (not vertical)
4. **Frame:** Chest up (standard talking head). Leave headroom.
5. **Tripod:** Mandatory. No handheld. Phone must be perfectly still.
6. **Apps for advanced control:**
   - Blackmagic Camera (free) - full manual control over exposure, white balance
   - FiLMiC Pro (~$15) - professional camera controls
   - Built-in Camera app - perfectly fine for most creators

### Background/Set Design

**Match your setting to your course topic:**
- AI/tech course = clean desk, laptop visible, minimal setup
- Koh Phangan visible through window = lifestyle positioning (palm trees, natural light)
- Simple white/neutral wall works perfectly
- Add 1-2 on-brand items (a plant, a book, branded mug)

**What to avoid:**
- Messy, cluttered backgrounds
- Distracting posters or artwork
- Bright windows behind you
- Moving elements (fans, curtains blowing)

**Pro tip from Caleb Wojcik:** Change clothes between modules in longer courses. For a 5-lesson course, one outfit is fine, but wearing a different shirt for the "talking head" lessons vs. screen recording gives visual variety.

## 3. RECORDING WORKFLOW

### The Hybrid Format (Talking Head + Screen Recording)

This is the ideal format for "Your First AI Assistant":

```
PATTERN PER LESSON:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  10-15 sec: Talking head intro              │
│  "In this lesson, I'll show you how to..."  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  3-5 min: Screen recording                  │
│  (with face bubble in corner OR no face)    │
│  Actual demonstration of Claude             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  15-30 sec: Talking head outro              │
│  "Now go do this one thing..."              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Screen Recording Tools Comparison

| Tool | Best For | Price | Key Feature |
|------|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Tella** | Course creators | $9/mo | Record in clips, fix mistakes, 30+ layouts |
| **Descript** | Text-based editing | $24/mo | Edit video by editing transcript, AI filler removal |
| **Loom** | Quick videos | Free/$20 | Easiest to use, face bubble overlay |
| **OBS Studio** | Advanced users | Free | Most powerful, steep learning curve |
| **Camtasia** | Full production | $250 one-time | Best all-in-one for courses |
| **ScreenFlow** | Mac users | $129 | Record screen + webcam simultaneously |

**Top recommendation: Descript**
- Record screen + webcam
- Automatic transcription
- Edit video BY EDITING THE TEXT (delete a word in the transcript = deletes it from the video)
- One-click filler word removal ("um", "uh", "you know")
- Cuts editing time by 60-70% compared to Final Cut or Premiere
- Auto-generates captions
- $24/month

**Alternative: Tella**
- Record in clips (not one continuous take)
- Fix mistakes mid-session without redoing entire lesson
- 30+ layout options (vs Loom's 2 positions)
- Auto-remove filler words
- $9/month
- Jay Clouse recorded 38 videos and uploaded them all in a couple of hours

### OBS Studio (Free) for Screen + Webcam

If you want free and powerful:
1. Download OBS Studio (free, open source)
2. Create a new Scene
3. Add "Display Capture" source (records your screen)
4. Add "Video Capture Device" source (your webcam/iPhone)
5. Resize webcam to small circle in corner
6. Hit Record
7. **Downside:** No built-in editing. Must edit separately.

### Using iPhone as Webcam (Mac)

iPhone 16 can serve as a high-quality webcam:
- **Continuity Camera** (built into macOS) - wireless, automatic
- **Camo Studio** (app) - more control, better framing
- Mount iPhone on tripod behind your laptop, pointing at you
- Records your face while you do screen recording

### The "No-Face" Shortcut for Screen Recordings

> "Recording the desktop and your voice (without showing up on camera) makes it a lot easier to produce video lessons. You can record a sentence, wait 5-10 seconds, record the next thing, and it sounds like one continuous take."

**Recommendation for Kaniel:** For lessons 2-4 (Claude tutorials), consider screen + voiceover only (no face). This is:
- Faster to record
- Easier to edit
- Less stressful
- Many successful courses use this format exclusively

### Teleprompter Setup

**Best free teleprompter apps for iPhone:**

1. **BIGVU** (Free tier) - Records video + shows script simultaneously on the same phone. Best for short takes.
2. **PromptSmart** (Free Lite) - Voice recognition follows your speaking pace. Scrolls automatically.
3. **Teleprompter app** (Free) - Used by Netflix, BBC. Clean interface, adjustable speed.
4. **CapCut** (Free) - Has built-in teleprompter + video recording + auto-captions all in one app.

**Two-device method (recommended):**
- iPad/laptop shows the script (positioned just below the camera lens)
- iPhone on tripod records you
- Eyes move slightly down to read, then up to camera
- Position script as CLOSE to the lens as possible to maintain eye contact

**Caleb Wojcik's advice:** Most course instructors work from "robust outlines" rather than full scripts. Full scripts sound robotic. Bullet points feel more natural and conversational.

## 4. BATCH RECORDING STRATEGY

### Why Batch Record

- Visual consistency (same outfit, lighting, energy)
- Setup once, record everything
- "Flow state" improves after the first 1-2 lessons
- Editing is faster when all footage is similar
- Multiple creators confirm: 30 min of course content = ~2-3 hours of recording

### Kaniel's Recording Plan (One Morning)

| Order | Lesson | Type | Est. Recording Time |
|-------|--------|------|-------------------|
| 1st | Lesson 1: Why AI | Talking head (highest energy needed) | 15-20 min |
| 2nd | Lesson 5: Your System | Talking head | 15-20 min |
| BREAK | 10 minutes | Water, reset | - |
| 3rd | Lesson 2: Install Claude | Screen recording + voice | 20-25 min |
| 4th | Lesson 3: First Conversation | Screen recording + voice | 20-25 min |
| 5th | Lesson 4: Build Assistant | Screen recording + voice | 20-25 min |
| **Total** | | | **~2-2.5 hours** |

### Pre-Recording Day Checklist

**The day before:**
- [ ] Review all 5 scripts/bullet points
- [ ] Practice reading them aloud once (time yourself)
- [ ] Charge iPhone fully
- [ ] Charge microphone
- [ ] Clear desk/background area
- [ ] Prepare the Claude.ai tabs you'll demo
- [ ] Set up templates/prompts you'll show on screen
- [ ] Lay out your outfit (simple, dark, solid colors)

**Morning of recording:**
- [ ] Set up iPhone on tripod facing window
- [ ] Test audio - record 30 seconds, play back with headphones
- [ ] Test video - check framing, lighting, background
- [ ] Close all unnecessary browser tabs
- [ ] Open Claude.ai, have demo ready
- [ ] Water bottle at arm's reach
- [ ] Phone on silent, notifications off on ALL devices
- [ ] Family knows: DO NOT DISTURB for 3 hours
- [ ] Close windows/doors (reduce ambient noise)
- [ ] Turn off fans, AC if noisy

### Energy Management Tips

1. **Start with talking head lessons** (while energy is highest)
2. **Record your FAVORITE lesson first** - builds momentum
3. **Take 5-10 min breaks** between lessons - drink water, stretch
4. **Don't record more than 3 hours** - voice fatigue is real
5. **Snacks and drinks nearby** - don't waste energy walking to kitchen
6. **Use a "clapper"** at start of each take: "Lesson 3, take 2" - makes editing easier
7. **Caleb Wojcik:** "Be yourself PLUS 10-15% energy. The camera mutes personality."

### The "Different Day" Hack

If recording 5 lessons in one session is too much:
- Record talking head lessons (1 & 5) in one session
- Record screen recordings (2, 3, 4) in another session
- Change shirts between sessions to create visual variety

### What to Do When You Mess Up

- **Don't stop recording.** Pause, take a breath, say "take 2" and restart the sentence.
- In editing, you'll cut the mistake. Much faster than stopping and restarting.
- Multiple creators confirm: "Stumbling over words, saying a few 'ums' is normal. They don't bother students."
- Descript can remove filler words with one click.

## 5. EDITING WORKFLOW

### The Fast Editing Path (Recommended)

**Using Descript (cuts editing time by 60-70%):**

```
1. Import raw video → auto-transcription (2-3 min)
2. Read transcript → delete mistakes by deleting text
3. Click "Remove filler words" → removes all "um", "uh" automatically
4. Click "Remove silence" → tightens pacing
5. Add title cards between lessons (optional)
6. Export → upload to course platform
TOTAL TIME: 30-60 minutes for entire course
```

**Using Tella:**

```
1. Already recorded in clips → rearrange if needed
2. Trim beginnings/endings of each clip
3. Auto-remove filler words
4. Auto-generated captions
5. Export all lessons
TOTAL TIME: 30-45 minutes for entire course
```

**Using CapCut (free, mobile):**

```
1. Import raw video
2. Use "Auto captions" feature → generates Hebrew/English captions
3. Trim dead space, mistakes
4. Add text overlays for key points
5. Apply brand colors to captions (dark bg + white text + blue accent)
6. Export
TOTAL TIME: 15-30 min per lesson (1-2 hours total)
```

### Caption/Subtitle Strategy for Multilingual Course

**For Hebrew (RTL) captions:**
- Maestra.ai - generates Hebrew subtitles with RTL support, <1 min per video
- CapCut - supports auto-captions in multiple languages
- Descript - auto-transcription + export SRT files
- Simon Says (simonsaysai.com) - specialized Hebrew captioning

**Best workflow for 3 languages:**
1. Record the lesson in ONE language first (Hebrew = primary)
2. Auto-generate Hebrew captions with Maestra/CapCut
3. Record the SAME lesson in English (use same screen recordings, re-record voice)
4. Auto-generate English captions
5. Repeat for Spanish
6. Export with embedded captions per language version

**Pro tip:** For screen recording lessons, record the screen demo ONCE and re-dub the voiceover in each language. Saves huge time.

### Editing Checklist Per Lesson

- [ ] Remove all long pauses (over 2 seconds)
- [ ] Remove filler words (um, uh, you know, like)
- [ ] Add captions/subtitles
- [ ] Verify audio levels are consistent
- [ ] Add lesson title card at beginning (3 seconds)
- [ ] Add end card with "Next: Lesson X" (3 seconds)
- [ ] Color correct if needed (most iPhone footage is fine)
- [ ] Export at 1080p minimum

## 6. COURSE PRICING STRATEGY

### The Data on $27-$97 Pricing

**Mini-course pricing sweet spots:**

| Duration | Recommended Price | Conversion Rate | Notes |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|-------|
| Under 30 min | $27-$47 | 10-12% at checkout | Impulse buy territory |
| 30-60 min | $47-$97 | 5-8% at checkout | Still low-ticket |
| 1-2 hours | $97-$147 | 3-5% at checkout | Needs social proof |
| 2+ hours | $147-$297 | 1-3% at checkout | Requires testimonials |

**Source:** Digital products under $30 achieve 10-12% checkout conversion when paired with clear results.

### Why $27 Works for Kaniel

1. **Impulse buy** - No lengthy decision process, no spousal consultation needed
2. **Low risk** - Easy to justify, easy to refund
3. **Volume play** - Need fewer followers to generate meaningful revenue
4. **Buyer list building** - A list of BUYERS is 10x more valuable than a list of freebie seekers
5. **Upsell path** - $27 buyer becomes 999 NIS bootcamp candidate

### Low-Ticket Funnel Math

```
CONSERVATIVE SCENARIO:
- 10 sales/day x $27 = $8,100/month
- 30% take $47 upsell = $4,230/month
- Total: ~$12,330/month from one funnel

REALISTIC FIRST 90 DAYS:
- Month 1: 30-50 sales = $810-$1,350
- Month 2: 50-80 sales = $1,350-$2,160
- Month 3: 80-120 sales = $2,160-$3,240
- 90-day total: $4,320-$6,750

WITH EMAIL LIST (500+ subscribers):
- 3.5% conversion = 17 sales = $459 per email blast
- Send one email/week = ~$1,800/month from email alone
```

### The Full Value Ladder

```
FREE: PDF Guide ("5 AI Assistants Every Business Owner Needs")
  → captures email
$27: Mini-Course ("Your First AI Assistant" - 5 lessons, 30 min)
  → builds trust, creates BUYERS list
$47: Order Bump (+ Premium Prompt Library + Hebrew Cheat Sheet)
  → increases average order value at checkout
$97: Starter Kit (course + templates + prompt library + community access)
  → for serious students
$999: Bootcamp (live cohort, 4 weeks, hands-on, 10 spots)
  → real revenue, deep transformation
$2,997+: Done-For-You (Kaniel builds their AI system)
  → highest value, lowest volume
```

### Justin Welsh's Pricing Philosophy

- Started at $25-$50 for mini-courses
- Content under 1 hour encourages completion
- The mini-course validates demand; the upsell generates real revenue
- His Creator MBA averages $566 per transaction but he started much lower
- Key: "Students pay for the RESULT, not the content"

## 7. COURSE LAUNCH STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Pre-Launch (2-3 Weeks Before)

**Goal: Build anticipation and email list (target: 100-300 signups)**

| Day | Action | Platform |
|-----|--------|----------|
| Day 1-3 | Post "I'm building something" teaser content | Instagram Stories |
| Day 3-5 | Share behind-the-scenes of recording setup | Instagram Reels |
| Day 5-7 | Launch free PDF opt-in page | Instagram Bio Link |
| Day 7-14 | Post daily BTS content (scripts, Claude demos, filming) | Instagram + Stories |
| Day 14 | Send "something is coming" email to list | Email |

**Content ideas for pre-launch:**
- "Building in public" - show your recording setup, script writing, Claude demos
- Share quick tips from the course content (give away 10% for free)
- Ask audience: "What's your biggest struggle with AI?" (engagement + research)
- Post a "Day in my life" showing how AI agents help you

### Phase 2: Soft Launch (Days 1-3)

**Goal: Get first 10-20 sales + testimonials**

| Day | Action | Details |
|-----|--------|---------|
| Day 1 | Email list gets EARLY ACCESS | Launch discount: $19 (instead of $27) |
| Day 1 | Post announcement Reel | "It's live! Here's what I built for you" |
| Day 2 | Share first buyer feedback | Screenshot DMs, reactions |
| Day 3 | Send reminder email | "48 hours left at launch price" |

### Phase 3: Public Launch (Days 4-7)

| Day | Action | Details |
|-----|--------|---------|
| Day 4 | Price goes to $27 | Full public launch |
| Day 5 | Share student results | First testimonials, wins |
| Day 6 | FAQ email | Address top objections |
| Day 7 | "Last chance" Stories with countdown | Urgency for any bonuses |

### Phase 4: Evergreen (Ongoing)

- Course available permanently at $27 from Instagram bio link
- Weekly content naturally leads to course
- Scorecard quiz → course recommendation
- Every Reel ends with soft CTA: "Link in bio"

### Email Sequence Structure (Pre-Launch to Post-Purchase)

**Pre-launch warmup (2 emails):**
1. Email 1: "I'm building something for you" (story + teaser)
2. Email 2: "Here's a sneak peek" (share one lesson concept, build anticipation)

**Launch sequence (5 emails over 5 days):**
1. Email 1: Launch announcement + early bird price
2. Email 2: "Here's what you'll learn" + social proof
3. Email 3: FAQ + objection handling
4. Email 4: Student result/testimonial
5. Email 5: "Cart closing" / "Price going up" urgency

**Post-purchase sequence (4 emails):**
1. Email 1: Delivery + thank you + quick start guide
2. Email 2 (Day 2): Quick win tutorial from the course
3. Email 3 (Day 3): Related product offer / Starter Kit upsell
4. Email 4 (Day 5): Ask for testimonial + bootcamp waitlist

### Justin Welsh's $1.6M Launch Key Insights

- **Interest list:** 18,000 email signups before launch
- **Survey immediately:** Segmented by business stage, income source, challenges
- **Weekly warmup emails:** Documented course creation process
- **Personalized messaging:** Different emails for different segments
- **Result:** 2,850 sales, $566 average transaction, 38% lift from personalization
- **His key lesson:** "The difference between $55K and $1.6M wasn't the course quality but accepting I couldn't use one message for everyone."

### The Presale Validation Method (Jay Clouse)

Before recording a single minute of video:
1. Create landing page describing the course
2. Set presale price ($19 early bird)
3. Post about it on social media
4. **Rule: If you get 10 presales, build it. If not, pivot the topic.**

### For a Small Audience (500-2,000 followers)

**Realistic expectations:**
- Engaged email list of 500-1,000 is enough to launch
- Typical conversion: 2-5% into paying customers
- First launch target: $3,000-$5,000
- A LearnWorlds creator with 900 email subscribers achieved 3.5% conversion on a $99 course = $3,115 with zero ad spend
- Focus on engagement quality over audience size

### Conversion Rate Benchmarks

| Channel | Average Conversion | Good Conversion | Exceptional |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Email list | 2-5% | 5-8% | 10-12% |
| Instagram bio link | 0.5-1% | 1-2% | 3-5% |
| Paid ads | 1-2% | 3-5% | 5-8% |
| Webinar/live | 5-10% | 10-15% | 20%+ |

**Key insight from 2025-2026:** Live webinars convert better than anything else because they build trust in real time. Consider doing a free Instagram Live demo of Claude before launching the course.

## 8. WHAT MAKES COURSES SELL

### The 5 Elements That Drive Course Sales

**1. SPECIFICITY of Outcome**
- Bad: "Learn about AI"
- Good: "Set up your first AI assistant in 30 minutes and save 2-3 hours every day"
- Students pay for the RESULT, not the content

**2. PROOF of Results**
- Testimonials (even 2-3 are enough)
- Before/after screenshots
- "I did this exact thing and here's what happened"
- Build-in-public content serves as proof

**3. RISK REVERSAL**
- Money-back guarantee removes buying friction
- "If you don't save at least 1 hour in your first week, full refund"
- Courses with guarantees convert 20-30% higher

**4. URGENCY**
- Launch pricing (limited time)
- Limited bonuses
- Cohort deadlines (for bootcamp)
- "Only 50 spots at this price"

**5. TRUST**
- Your personal story (October 7th → rebuild → AI-first life)
- Consistency of content over time
- Social proof (followers, engagement, results)
- Quality of free content predicts course quality

### The $27 Offer Formula

Your $27 course should feel like it's worth $270. How:
- Solve a SPECIFIC micro-problem with an immediate result
- Over-deliver on supporting materials (templates, prompts, guides)
- Include an "unexpected bonus" (extra prompt library, cheat sheet)
- Keep delivery fast and professionally packaged
- Include one strategic upsell option at checkout

### What NOT to Do

1. Don't try to teach EVERYTHING about AI in one course
2. Don't compete on price (race to the bottom)
3. Don't launch without at least 100 email subscribers
4. Don't skip the guarantee (reduces conversions by 20-30%)
5. Don't forget the thank-you page upsell (biggest missed opportunity)
6. Don't price below $19 (attracts uncommitted students who won't complete)

## 9. CREATOR FRAMEWORKS & METHODS

### Justin Welsh's 8-Step Mini-Course Framework

| Step | Action | Time |
|------|--------|------|
| 1 | Choose a VERY specific topic | 15 min |
| 2 | Create interest page, collect emails | 1 hour |
| 3 | Outline 3-5 main lessons (each = one concept) | 30 min |
| 4 | Create content: intro > explain > examples > action | 2-4 hours |
| 5 | Set up delivery platform | 1 hour |
| 6 | Price between $25-$50 | - |
| 7 | Convert interest page → sales page | 1 hour |
| 8 | Launch with email + social | Ongoing |

### Dan Koe's Digital Product Formula

1. **Write a curriculum** for education (text-based)
2. **Film screen recordings** showing HOW to use the system
3. **Create templates** for others to use (downloadable)
4. **Price it and send traffic**

> "The curriculum is based around a system that requires teaching the depth with text and showing implementation with video."

### Amy Porterfield's Minimum Viable Course

> "Create your course NOW and build it over time."

- Start with a one-hour workshop format
- Launch with what you have (5 lessons is enough)
- Refine after your first launch based on student feedback
- Don't wait until it's "perfect" - it never will be
- Baby steps with short-term goals
- Be ready to pivot based on what students actually need

### Caleb Wojcik's Filming Process (20+ Courses Filmed)

1. **Script vs. Outline:** Most clients work off robust outlines, not full scripts
2. **Talking to camera becomes easy** once you have an outline
3. **Shallow depth of field** (f/3.5 on iPhone Portrait mode) - bokeh background looks professional
4. **Change clothes between modules** for visual variety
5. **Straight cuts timed with speech** - no fancy transitions needed
6. **On-camera energy:** "Be yourself PLUS 10-15%. The camera mutes personality."
7. **Mistakes are okay** - editing handles corrections

### Wes Kao's Cohort Course Principles

1. **Focus on HOW, not WHAT/WHY** (80/20 rule)
2. **"If you build it, they will come" is the biggest myth** - validate first
3. **Zero room for BS** - cohort courses expose weak content instantly
4. **Minimum viable cohort: 10-15 students** - enough for interaction
5. **Ship in 2 weeks and iterate** - don't spend months perfecting

### Ali Abdaal's Content Principles

1. **Eliminate filler** - stick to the core message
2. **Text overlays** highlight important points and keep viewers engaged
3. **Jump cuts** between sentences keep energy high
4. **Teach what you'd want to learn** - your enthusiasm is contagious

## 10. TOOLS & PLATFORMS

### Recording Stack for Kaniel

**Primary (talking head):**
- iPhone 16 on tripod
- Wireless lavalier microphone
- Natural Koh Phangan light (window-facing)
- BIGVU or PromptSmart for teleprompter

**Primary (screen recording):**
- Descript ($24/mo) - record + edit + captions in one tool
- OR Tella ($9/mo) - clip-based recording with built-in editing
- OR OBS Studio (free) - most powerful but steepest learning curve

**Editing:**
- Descript - edit by editing the transcript text
- OR CapCut (free) - mobile editing with auto-captions
- OR just use Tella's built-in editor

**Captions/Subtitles:**
- Descript - auto-transcription in multiple languages
- Maestra.ai - Hebrew subtitle generation with RTL support
- CapCut - auto-captions (supports bilingual)

### Course Hosting

| Platform | Cost | Best For | Notes |
|----------|------|----------|-------|
| **GitHub Pages** (current) | Free | Already built! | Custom course platform exists |
| Gumroad | Free + 10% fee | Simplest payment | Good for first product |
| LemonSqueezy | 5% + $0.50 | Tax compliance | Handles global taxes |
| Teachable | $39/mo | Growing creators | Overkill for first product |
| Stan Store | $29/mo | Instagram creators | Optimized for IG bio links |

**Recommendation:** Keep GitHub Pages for hosting (already built). Add LemonSqueezy for payment processing only. Their 5% fee is worth the global tax compliance, especially selling in 3 languages/currencies.

### Payment & Checkout

- **LemonSqueezy** - Handles taxes globally (critical for selling in NIS + USD + EUR)
- **Stripe** - If you want more control, but you handle taxes yourself
- **Gumroad** - Simplest setup, 10% fee

## 11. MULTILINGUAL RECORDING STRATEGY

### How to Record the Same Course in 3 Languages Efficiently

**Option A: Re-record everything (most authentic, most time)**
- Record all 5 lessons in Hebrew first
- Then all 5 in English
- Then all 5 in Spanish
- Total: 3 sessions x 2-3 hours = 6-9 hours
- Pro: Most natural delivery per language
- Con: Takes 3x the time

**Option B: Hybrid (recommended for Kaniel)**
- Record screen demos ONCE (no language-specific content on screen)
- Record voiceover in each language separately
- Record talking head intros/outros in each language
- Total: ~4-5 hours total
- Pro: Screen recordings are reusable across languages
- Con: Voiceover dubbing takes practice

**Option C: Record one language + subtitle/dub**
- Record everything in Hebrew (primary audience)
- Add English and Spanish subtitles
- OR use AI dubbing (less authentic, but fastest)
- Total: 2-3 hours + subtitle generation
- Pro: Fastest
- Con: Less personal for non-Hebrew speakers

**Recommendation:** Start with Option A for highest quality. Record Hebrew first (your most comfortable language), then English, then Spanish. The scripts already exist in all 3 languages.

### Language-Specific Tips

**Hebrew (RTL):**
- Ensure captions render right-to-left
- Mixed LTR elements (numbers, URLs, English terms) should remain readable
- Test on mobile to verify Hebrew caption display
- Use Heebo font for captions (matches brand)

**English:**
- Most tools default to English, so fewer technical challenges
- Speak slightly slower than natural (international audience)
- Use Inter font for captions (matches brand)

**Spanish:**
- Enunciate clearly (many dialects)
- Neutral Spanish (not too regional)
- Test auto-captions for accuracy

## 12. MISTAKES TO AVOID

### The 15 Most Common Course Creation Mistakes

1. **Don't build 3 courses at once** - Jay Clouse tried this. His worst launch ever.
2. **Don't wait for "perfect"** - Ship, get feedback, iterate.
3. **Don't use complex editing software** - Descript/Tella are enough for 90% of cases.
4. **Don't price at $9.99** - Below $19 attracts uncommitted students who won't complete.
5. **Don't skip the presale** - Validate demand before investing production time.
6. **Don't launch without an email list** - Social media reach is unpredictable.
7. **Don't forget the upsell** - The $27 course is a lead generator, not the main revenue.
8. **Don't record in noisy environments** - Audio quality > video quality.
9. **Don't film more than 3 hours in one day** - Voice fatigue destroys quality.
10. **Don't underestimate supporting materials** - Text summaries + action steps double perceived value.
11. **Don't over-script** - Sounds robotic. Use bullet points, not word-for-word scripts.
12. **Don't neglect the thank-you page** - Biggest missed revenue opportunity (upsell here).
13. **Don't teach theory without demos** - Show the thing working, not just talk about it.
14. **Don't record vertically** - Course videos are landscape/horizontal.
15. **Don't forget to TEST the student experience** - Go through the entire course as a student before launching.
