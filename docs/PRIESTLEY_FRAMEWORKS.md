## 1. KEY PERSON OF INFLUENCE - The 5 Steps

### The Framework

Daniel Priestley's core thesis: In every industry, there are "Key People of Influence" who attract opportunities, clients, and partnerships effortlessly. The difference is not talent -- it is visibility, credibility, and a system. The 5 steps are sequential and build on each other.

### Step 1: PITCH (שלב הפיץ')

**What it is:** A 30-40 second introduction that makes people instantly understand what you do AND want to know more.

**Priestley's Pitch Framework - "Name, Same, Fame, Aim, Game":**

| Element | What It Does | Kaniel's Version |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **Name** | Your name + business | "אני קניאל טורג'מן" |
| **Same** | Something relatable they know | "אתה מכיר את התחושה שאתה מכבה שריפות כל היום? שהראש תמיד במקום אחר?" |
| **Fame** | Your unique value / what makes you different | "בניתי עסק סולארי ל-10 מיליון שקל, עברתי את 7 באוקטובר, ו-400 יום מילואים. עכשיו אני חי בתאילנד עם 5 סוכני AI שמנהלים לי את החיים." |
| **Aim** | What you are working on right now | "אני מלמד יזמים ובעלי עסקים לבנות את הסוכן הראשון שלהם ב-Claude -- לקבל 3 שעות ביום חזרה." |
| **Game** | A contrarian idea that sparks curiosity | "כל מערכת שאני בונה היום צריכה UX אנושי ו-UX אג'נטי -- במקביל. זה העתיד." |

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Write the pitch in Hebrew (40 seconds spoken)
- [ ] Write the pitch in English (40 seconds spoken)
- [ ] Record a video of the pitch for Instagram bio / pinned reel
- [ ] Use this pitch in every DM conversation, Instagram bio, speaking opportunity
- [ ] Test it: If someone says "tell me more" -- it worked. If they say "cool" -- rewrite.

### Step 2: PUBLISH (שלב הפרסום)

**What it is:** Experts share their knowledge publicly. Publishing = proof of expertise. You are already doing this with Instagram content, but Priestley means something bigger.

**The Publishing Hierarchy (from most impact to least):**

| Level | Format | Kaniel's Action |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| **1. Book / Guide** | Long-form authority piece | Write a 30-50 page Hebrew PDF: "המדריך ליזמים: סוכן AI ראשון ב-60 דקות" |
| **2. Video Series** | Educational content (YouTube/IG) | You already have 7 scripts -- this IS your publishing |
| **3. Newsletter** | Regular insights | Start a weekly WhatsApp broadcast / Telegram channel |
| **4. Podcast** | Long-form conversations | Later: interview Israeli entrepreneurs using AI |
| **5. Social Posts** | Short-form content | Instagram Reels (already in progress) |

**The Key Insight:** Your FREE PDF guide is not your product -- it is your PUBLISHING credential. It positions you as the authority BEFORE you sell anything.

**Specific Publishing Plan for Kaniel:**

1. **Short-term (Week 1-2):** Continue Instagram publishing (already planned)
2. **Medium-term (Week 3-4):** Write a FREE Hebrew PDF guide: "5 סוכני AI שכל בעל עסק צריך" (15-20 pages)
3. **Longer-term (Month 2):** Convert guide into a mini email/WhatsApp course (5 days, 1 lesson per day)

### Step 3: PRODUCT (שלב המוצר)

**What it is:** Transition from trading time-for-money to a scalable product ecosystem. Priestley calls this the "Ascending Transaction Model" (covered in detail in section 2 below).

**Key principle:** Do NOT build your product first. Build your audience, publish, validate demand, THEN create the product based on what people actually want.

### Step 4: PROFILE (שלב הפרופיל)

**What it is:** Be SEEN as the go-to person. This is about strategic visibility, not vanity metrics.

**Kaniel's Profile-Building Actions:**

| Action | Details | Timeline |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Instagram optimization | Bio, pinned posts, highlights | This week |
| Hebrew AI content niche | You are FIRST in this niche -- own it | Ongoing |
| Guest appearances | Reach out to 3 Israeli business podcasts | Month 2 |
| Facebook groups | Post insights in Israeli entrepreneur groups (Startup Nation, etc.) | Weekly |
| Collaborations | Find 2-3 Israeli digital nomads / entrepreneurs in similar space | Month 2 |

### Step 5: PARTNERSHIPS (שלב השותפויות)

**What it is:** Strategic alliances that expand your reach beyond what you can do alone.

**Potential partnerships for Kaniel:**

| Partner Type | Who | What You Give | What You Get |
|-------------|-----|---------------|--------------|
| Israeli entrepreneur communities | Digital Israel, Startup Nation Central | Free AI workshops / content | Access to audience |
| Israeli digital nomad groups | Facebook groups, Telegram | AI setup guides | Referrals |
| Complementary service providers | VAs, business coaches, accountants | "My AI agent replaces your need for X" | Cross-referrals |
| Tool partnerships | Claude/Anthropic communities | Hebrew tutorials | Visibility in AI space |

## 2. THE ASCENDING TRANSACTION MODEL

### The Framework

Priestley says: "Your product won't make you money. Your product ECOSYSTEM will make you money."

Most entrepreneurs have ONE product. Priestley says you need FOUR, arranged in an ascending ladder:

```
LEVEL 4: Product for Clients (for existing clients only)
   ^
LEVEL 3: Core Product (your main offering -- where 80% of revenue comes from)
   ^
LEVEL 2: Product for Prospects (low-cost entry point -- qualifies buyers)
   ^
LEVEL 1: Gifts (free -- builds awareness, captures attention)
```

### Applied to Kaniel's AI Agent Business:

## 3. OVERSUBSCRIBED - The 5 Campaign Phases

### The Core Principle

> "Get more people interested in your product than you could possibly serve. Do NOT start selling until that happens."

This is the opposite of how most people launch. Most people build a product, then try to find customers. Priestley says: Find customers FIRST, then build/launch the product.

### The Signaling Formula

Before launching, you need to collect "signals of interest." The ratio depends on signal strength:

| Signal Type | Ratio Needed | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Strong signal** (filled out application, paid deposit) | 5:1 | 50 applications for 10 spots |
| **Medium signal** (registered interest, joined waitlist) | 10:1 | 100 registrations for 10 spots |
| **Soft signal** (downloaded guide, watched webinar) | 100:1 | 1,000 downloads for 10 spots |

**For Kaniel's first cohort of 10 people, you need:**
- 50 people who fill out a detailed interest form, OR
- 100 people on a waitlist, OR
- 1,000 people who downloaded your free guide

### Phase 1: CAMPAIGN PLANNING (תכנון)

**Duration:** 1-2 weeks
**Goal:** Define capacity, timeline, and target.

**Action Items:**

| Decision | Kaniel's Answer |
|----------|----------------|
| **Capacity:** How many can you serve? | 10 people (first cohort -- keep it small) |
| **When:** Launch date? | 8 weeks from now (after building audience + demand) |
| **Price:** How much? | 999 NIS (founder's price) |
| **Format:** How will you deliver? | 4 weekly Zoom calls + WhatsApp group + recorded lessons |
| **Timeline:** When does it run? | 4 weeks, starting [launch date + 1 week] |

**Create Your Campaign Calendar:**

```
Weeks 1-3:  BUILD AUDIENCE (Instagram content, free guide, scorecard)
Weeks 4-6:  BUILD DEMAND (waitlist, testimonials from free help, live sessions)
Week 7:     ANNOUNCE (open registration, limited to 10)
Week 8:     CLOSE (registration closes, begin bootcamp)
Weeks 9-12: DELIVER (4-week bootcamp)
Week 13:    CELEBRATE + PLAN COHORT 2
```

### Phase 2: BUILD UP (בנייה)

**Duration:** 4-6 weeks
**Goal:** Create so much interest that demand exceeds your 10 spots.

**The Build-Up Toolkit:**

| Activity | Frequency | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Instagram Reels | 4x/week | Attract new followers, demonstrate expertise |
| Free guide promotion | Constant CTA in bio | Collect emails/phone numbers (soft signals) |
| Scorecard / Quiz | Ongoing | Qualify leads, collect data |
| Live Q&A on Instagram | 1x/week | Build trust, show face, answer questions |
| WhatsApp broadcast tips | 3x/week | Nurture warm audience |
| Help 3-5 people for FREE | One-time | Get testimonials + case studies before launch |
| "Behind the scenes" Stories | Daily | Show you building the course = transparency |

**The FREE Help Strategy (Critical):**
Before you charge anyone, help 3-5 friends or DM contacts set up Claude + their first agent FOR FREE. Document everything:
- Before/after screenshots
- Their testimonial (video or text)
- Specific results (how many hours saved, what they automated)
- These become your "proof" for the paid launch

### Phase 3: RELEASE WHEN OVERSUBSCRIBED (שחרור)

**Duration:** 1 week
**Goal:** Open registration ONLY when demand exceeds supply.

**The Release Sequence:**

**Day 1 - Announce:**
- Instagram Reel: "I'm opening 10 spots for my AI First Bootcamp"
- Show the waitlist numbers: "83 people registered interest. 10 spots available."
- Share testimonials from free beta users
- Link to registration of interest form (NOT a buy button)

**Day 2-3 - Build Urgency:**
- Instagram Stories: "42 people filled out the form. 10 spots. Choosing this week."
- Share specific results: "רונן from Tel Aviv set up his first agent in 60 minutes. Now saves 2 hours/day on email."
- DM people who engaged most with your content

**Day 4-5 - Selection:**
- Review applications
- Choose 10 based on fit (not just first-come)
- Send acceptance messages personally
- Send "waitlist for next cohort" messages to the rest

**Day 6-7 - Close:**
- Post "SOLD OUT" on Instagram
- Add remaining people to Cohort 2 waitlist
- This creates instant demand for the next round

### Phase 4: REMARKABLE DELIVERY (אספקה יוצאת דופן)

**Duration:** 4 weeks (the bootcamp itself)
**Goal:** OVER-deliver. Give them more than they expected.

**Priestley's Principle:** Set expectations slightly lower, then exceed them.

| What You Promise | What You Actually Deliver |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
| 4 group calls | 4 group calls + bonus 1:1 15-min setup review |
| WhatsApp support | WhatsApp support + you respond within 2 hours |
| Basic agent setup | Full agent setup + custom prompt templates |
| "Build your first agent" | Build first agent + second agent as bonus |

**Document everything during delivery:**
- Screenshot results
- Record testimonials
- Track metrics (hours saved, agents built)
- These fuel Cohort 2 marketing

### Phase 5: CELEBRATE AND INNOVATE (חגיגה + חדשנות)

**Duration:** 1-2 weeks after bootcamp ends
**Goal:** Broadcast success, start next campaign.

**Actions:**
- Post a "results" reel: "10 יזמים ישראלים. 4 שבועות. הנה מה שקרה."
- Share 3-5 testimonial clips
- Announce Cohort 2 waitlist is open
- Raise price by 50% for next cohort
- Priestley: "Demand breeds demand. People want what's hard to get."

## 4. THE 7-11-4 RULE

### The Framework

Before someone trusts you enough to buy, they need:

| Component | Requirement | What It Means |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
| **7 Hours** | Spend 7 hours engaging with your content | They watched your videos, read your guide, attended your live |
| **11 Touchpoints** | Have 11 interactions with your brand | Saw a reel, read a story, opened a DM, downloaded the guide, took the quiz, etc. |
| **4 Locations** | Encounter you in 4 different contexts | Instagram, WhatsApp, email/PDF guide, live Zoom call |

### Why This Matters for Kaniel

You CANNOT sell on the first touchpoint. Someone who just found your Instagram reel is NOT ready to buy. They need to go through the 7-11-4 journey first.

### Building the 7 Hours

| Content Type | Time Per Piece | How Many Needed | Total Hours |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Instagram Reels (45s each) | 0.75 min | 50 reels watched | 0.6 hours |
| Free PDF Guide (20 pages) | 30 min | 1 read | 0.5 hours |
| Instagram Stories (daily) | 2 min/day | 30 days | 1.0 hour |
| Live Q&A Sessions | 60 min | 2 sessions attended | 2.0 hours |
| WhatsApp tips | 2 min each | 30 tips | 1.0 hour |
| Scorecard + results review | 15 min | 1 completion | 0.25 hours |
| Free mini-course (5 days) | 15 min/day | 5 days | 1.25 hours |
| DM conversations | 10 min | 3 conversations | 0.5 hours |
| **TOTAL** | | | **~7.1 hours** |

### Building the 11 Touchpoints

| # | Touchpoint | Type |
|---|-----------|------|
| 1 | Sees first Instagram Reel | Discovery |
| 2 | Visits profile, reads bio | Interest |
| 3 | Watches 2-3 more Reels | Engagement |
| 4 | Views Instagram Stories | Engagement |
| 5 | Downloads free PDF guide (clicks bio link) | Lead capture |
| 6 | Takes the AI Readiness Scorecard | Qualification |
| 7 | Joins WhatsApp broadcast | Nurture |
| 8 | Receives WhatsApp AI tips (3x/week) | Nurture |
| 9 | Attends live Q&A on Zoom or IG Live | Trust building |
| 10 | DMs you a question | Direct engagement |
| 11 | Receives registration of interest form | Sales |

### Covering 4 Locations

| # | Location | Content There |
|---|---------|---------------|
| 1 | **Instagram** | Reels, Stories, Lives, DMs |
| 2 | **WhatsApp** | Broadcast list, tips, course, personal DMs |
| 3 | **PDF / Email** | Free guide, scorecard results, course materials |
| 4 | **Zoom / Live** | Monthly Q&A, the bootcamp itself |

### Practical Implementation

**The funnel path a prospect takes:**

```
INSTAGRAM (discovery)
    |
    v
Watches 5+ reels --> Follows
    |
    v
Clicks bio link --> Downloads free guide (gives phone/email)
    |
    v
Takes AI Readiness Scorecard
    |
    v
Joins WhatsApp broadcast (automated tips)
    |
    v
Attends live Q&A
    |
    v
Receives DM: "Registration for Cohort 1 is open"
    |
    v
Fills registration of interest form
    |
    v
Accepted --> BUYS
```

## 5. SCORECARD AS LEAD MAGNET

### The Framework

Priestley's most powerful lead generation tool. NOT a traditional PDF lead magnet. It is an interactive quiz that:
1. Gives the prospect VALUE (they learn something about themselves)
2. Gives YOU DATA (you learn what they need)
3. Creates a CONVERSATION starter (the results)

**Key stat:** PDF lead magnets convert at 3-10%. Scorecard/quiz funnels convert at 30-50%.

### Kaniel's Scorecard: "AI Readiness Score"

**Title (Hebrew):** "כמה מוכן העסק שלך ל-AI? בדוק תוך 3 דקות"
**Title (English):** "How AI-Ready Is Your Business? Find out in 3 minutes"

### The Questions (10 questions, 3 minutes)

Each question is scored 1-5. Total score out of 50.

**Category 1: Current State (מצב נוכחי)**

| # | Question (Hebrew) | What It Reveals |
|---|-------------------|----------------|
| 1 | כמה שעות ביום אתה מבזבז על משימות חוזרות? (1=0-1, 5=5+) | Pain level |
| 2 | יש לך מערכת מסודרת לניהול המשימות שלך? (1=כן מושלם, 5=בלגן מוחלט) | Systems readiness |
| 3 | כמה פעמים בשבוע אתה מרגיש שאתה "מכבה שריפות"? (1=אף פעם, 5=כל יום) | Urgency of problem |

**Category 2: AI Knowledge (ידע ב-AI)**

| # | Question (Hebrew) | What It Reveals |
|---|-------------------|----------------|
| 4 | האם השתמשת אי פעם ב-ChatGPT, Claude, או כלי AI אחר? (1=כל יום, 5=אף פעם) | Starting point |
| 5 | האם יש לך תהליך עסקי אחד שהייתי רוצה לאוטומט? (1=כבר אוטומטי, 5=הכל ידני) | Opportunity size |

**Category 3: Lifestyle (סגנון חיים)**

| # | Question (Hebrew) | What It Reveals |
|---|-------------------|----------------|
| 6 | כמה זמן ביום אתה מקדיש לדברים שבאמת חשובים לך (משפחה, ספורט, תחביבים)? (1=3+ שעות, 5=אין זמן) | Motivation level |
| 7 | האם אתה מרגיש ששליטה על הזמן שלך מתמעטת? (1=שולט לגמרי, 5=הזמן שולט בי) | Emotional trigger |

**Category 4: Readiness (מוכנות)**

| # | Question (Hebrew) | What It Reveals |
|---|-------------------|----------------|
| 8 | כמה מוכן אתה להשקיע 1-2 שעות ללמוד כלי חדש שיחסוך לך 3 שעות ביום? (1=מחר, 5=אין לי זמן) | Purchase intent |
| 9 | מה הדבר הראשון שהיית רוצה שסוכן AI יעשה בשבילך? (open text) | Product insight |
| 10 | מה מונע ממך להתחיל עם AI היום? (open text) | Objection mapping |

### Scoring and Segmentation

| Score | Category | Follow-Up |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **40-50** | "AI Survival Mode" (מצב הישרדות) | Urgent: Send core product offer |
| **25-39** | "Ready for Upgrade" (מוכן לשדרוג) | Warm: Nurture with tips + invite to live Q&A |
| **10-24** | "Getting Started" (בהתחלה) | Cool: Send free guide + WhatsApp tips |

### Results Page Content

**For high scorers (40-50):**
> "העסק שלך צועק ל-AI. אתה מבזבז שעות על דברים שסוכן יכול לעשות בשבילך. החדשות הטובות? אני יכול לעזור לך לבנות את הסוכן הראשון שלך תוך שבוע. הצטרף לרשימת ההמתנה ל-AI First Bootcamp."

**For medium scorers (25-39):**
> "יש לך בסיס טוב, אבל יש הרבה מקום לשיפור. התחל עם המדריך החינמי שלי: '5 סוכני AI שכל בעל עסק צריך'. וכשתהיה מוכן -- הצטרף לרשימת ההמתנה."

**For low scorers (10-24):**
> "אתה בהתחלה -- וזה בסדר גמור! התחל עם הטיפים השבועיים שלי בוואטסאפ. כל שבוע טיפ קצר שיעזור לך להכיר את עולם ה-AI."

### Implementation Options

| Platform | Cost | Complexity | Best For |
|----------|------|-----------|----------|
| **ScoreApp.com** (Priestley's own tool) | $49/mo | Low | Full-featured, professional |
| **Typeform** | Free-$25/mo | Low | Simple, good design |
| **Google Forms + manual scoring** | Free | Medium | MVP / testing |
| **Custom build (Claude + simple web page)** | Free | Higher | Full control, practice what you preach |

**Recommendation:** Start with Typeform or Google Forms for MVP. Upgrade to ScoreApp when you have 100+ completions and want automation.

## 6. CAMPAIGN DRIVEN ENTERPRISE MODEL

### The Framework

Instead of trying to sell all the time, operate in CAMPAIGNS. Each campaign is a focused burst of activity with a clear start and end.

### The 4-Layer Campaign Structure

Priestley's businesses run campaigns at 4 levels simultaneously:

```
YEARLY MESSAGE (one consistent theme for all of 2026)
    |
    |--- QUARTERLY CAMPAIGNS (4 big pushes per year)
    |       |
    |       |--- MONTHLY CAMPAIGNS (interest-gathering)
    |       |       |
    |       |       |--- WEEKLY CONTENT (stay visible)
```

### Applied to Kaniel's Business:

## 7. THE 24 ASSETS FRAMEWORK
